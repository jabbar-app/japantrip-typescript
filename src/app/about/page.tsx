          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Japan Smart Trip Planner</strong> is an open source travel planning app built with developers and first-time travelers in mind. It allows you to create a smart, personalized itinerary for Japan â€” complete with day-by-day timelines, categorized destinations, and a smooth planning experience.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            What started as a personal project to solve my own travel pain point has now become a fullstack playground powered entirely by TypeScript. From a drag-and-drop itinerary builder to a RESTful API backend, every component is designed for both usability and scalability.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The project embraces modern best practices: edge-ready API routes, type-safe ORM with Prisma, structured file-based routing with Next.js App Router, reusable components, and state management ready to scale.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Whether you`re a solo traveler looking to organize your Tokyo trip, a developer curious about clean architecture with TypeScript, or a company looking for tech talent passionate about real-world solutions â€” this project is built for you.
          </p>
